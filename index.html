<h2>Shmoot's Various Projects</h2>
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href = "povchem/">PovChem</a>: Create animated POV-Ray scenes from your
    Spacechem solutions.  Mostly automatically.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href = "fpc/">Fallout Password Cracker</a>: Computer terminals in the
    3D-era <i>Fallout</i> games all seem to share a certain fatal security
    vulnerability.  How very careless of the manufacturer.  This tool will
    help you exploit that vulnerability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href = "npnp/">'Nother Powerful Nifty Purchase</a>: A few levels into
    Skyrim you'll be hauling back more loot than a merchant can buy at once,
    but if you don't sell them exactly as much in loot as they have in gold then
    you're not getting as good a deal as you should be:  If they have any gold
    left at the end then you're leaving them some gold that you should have,
    and if you sell something for less than it is worth to get that gold then
    you're leaving yourself with less gold than you should have.  This tool will
    find a subset of your loot that exactly matches the merchant's available
    gold, if such a subset exists.  Possibly also useful elsewhere.  It's the
    subset sum problem.
