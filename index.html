<h2>Shmoot's Various Projects</h2>
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href = "povchem/">PovChem</a>: Create animated POV-Ray scenes from your
    <span class = "titleofsomething">Spacechem</span> solutions.  Mostly
    automatically.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href = "fpc/">Fallout Password Cracker</a>: Computer terminals in the
    3D-era <span class = "titleofsomething">Fallout</span> games all seem to
    share a certain fatal security vulnerability.  How very careless of the
    manufacturer.  This tool will help you exploit that vulnerability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href = "npnp/">'Nother Powerful Nifty Purchase</a>: A few levels into
    <span class = "titleofsomething">Skyrim</span> you'll be hauling back more
    loot than a merchant can buy at once, but if you don't sell them exactly as
    much in loot as they have in gold then you're not getting as good a deal as
    you should be:  If they have any gold left at the end then you're leaving
    them some gold that you should have, and if you sell them something for less
    than it is worth to get that gold then you'll eventually leave yourself with
    less gold than you should have.  This tool will find a subset of your loot
    that exactly matches the merchant's available gold, if such a subset exists.
    Possibly also useful elsewhere.  It's the subset sum problem.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href = "brewlab/">Skyrim Alchemy Brew Lab</a>: I'm often running off to
    UESP to remind myself of the best recipe for a particular potion, or to see
    how many extra effects I can cram in.  So I wrote this.  I'm sure they'll
    appreciate the bandwidth savings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href = "dstcalendar">Don't Starve Together Calendar</a>. Because why
    would I make a much more convenient in-game mod?
  </li>
</ul>
